# REFRESH TOKEN TESTING CHECKLIST

## Pre-Implementation Tests
- [ ] Current authentication system works correctly
- [ ] All existing endpoints are functional
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is properly configured
- [ ] Database connections are stable

## Environment Setup Tests
- [ ] JWT_REFRESH_SECRET environment variable is set
- [ ] JWT_REFRESH_SECRET is different from JWT_SECRET
- [ ] Both secrets are at least 32 characters long
- [ ] Environment variables are loaded correctly in the application

## Model Tests
- [ ] User model can save with refreshToken field
- [ ] User model can save with refreshTokenExpiresAt field
- [ ] Existing users continue to work without refresh token fields
- [ ] New user creation works with refresh token fields

## JWT Utility Tests
- [ ] signRefreshToken function generates valid tokens
- [ ] verifyRefreshToken function validates tokens correctly
- [ ] verifyRefreshToken rejects expired tokens
- [ ] verifyRefreshToken rejects invalid tokens
- [ ] generateTokenPair returns both access and refresh tokens

## Service Layer Tests
- [ ] AuthService.generateTokenPair works correctly
- [ ] AuthService.storeRefreshToken saves to database
- [ ] AuthService.validateRefreshToken validates correctly
- [ ] AuthService.refreshAccessToken generates new token pair
- [ ] AuthService.revokeRefreshToken clears token from database
- [ ] AuthService.revokeAllRefreshTokens clears all user sessions

## RefreshTokenService Tests
- [ ] Token blacklisting works correctly
- [ ] User session tracking works
- [ ] Token cleanup functionality works
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable under load
- [ ] Multiple sessions per user are handled correctly

## Use Case Tests
- [ ] loginWithRefreshToken returns correct token pair
- [ ] refreshToken use case validates and returns new tokens
- [ ] logoutWithRefreshToken revokes refresh token
- [ ] logoutAllDevices revokes all user sessions

## Controller Tests
- [ ] POST /auth/login-refresh endpoint works
- [ ] POST /auth/refresh-token endpoint works
- [ ] POST /auth/logout-refresh endpoint works
- [ ] POST /auth/logout-all endpoint works
- [ ] Error handling works for all endpoints
- [ ] Cookies are set correctly for all endpoints

## Middleware Tests
- [ ] authMiddlewareWithRefreshToken validates access tokens
- [ ] Middleware handles refresh token cookies correctly
- [ ] autoRefreshMiddleware refreshes expired tokens
- [ ] Role-based access control still works
- [ ] Error responses are properly formatted

## Integration Tests
- [ ] Complete login flow with refresh tokens works
- [ ] Token refresh flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Logout flow properly cleans up tokens
- [ ] Concurrent requests handle token refresh correctly
- [ ] Multiple device login/logout scenarios work

## Security Tests
- [ ] Old refresh tokens cannot be reused after refresh
- [ ] Blacklisted tokens are properly rejected
- [ ] Token expiration is enforced correctly
- [ ] Cross-user token access is prevented
- [ ] Invalid tokens return appropriate error messages

## Performance Tests
- [ ] Token generation performance is acceptable
- [ ] Token validation performance is acceptable
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable with many tokens
- [ ] Database queries are efficient
- [ ] Token cleanup doesn't impact performance

## Edge Case Tests
- [ ] Malformed refresh token handling
- [ ] Expired refresh token handling
- [ ] Non-existent user refresh token handling
- [ ] Concurrent token refresh attempts
- [ ] Database connection failure during token operations

## Backward Compatibility Tests
- [ ] Existing /auth/login endpoint still works
- [ ] Existing clients can continue using old authentication
- [ ] Mixed authentication (old and new) works simultaneously
- [ ] No breaking changes for existing API consumers

## Client Integration Tests
- [ ] Web client can receive and store tokens
- [ ] Mobile client can handle token refresh
- [ ] API documentation is updated
- [ ] Client-side token refresh interceptors work
- [ ] Error handling on client side is proper

## Production Readiness Tests
- [ ] Environment variables are properly set in production
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Load testing passes with refresh tokens
- [ ] Monitoring and logging capture refresh token events
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures account for token state

## Rollback Plan Tests
- [ ] Can disable refresh token features without breaking existing auth
- [ ] Database rollback procedures are tested
- [ ] Client applications can fall back to old authentication
- [ ] Monitoring can detect rollback necessity

## Post-Deployment Tests
- [ ] All authentication flows work in production
- [ ] Performance metrics are within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Error rates are within expected levels
- [ ] Token refresh rates are reasonable
- [ ] No memory leaks detected in production

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path Tests
1. **New User Registration and Login**
   - Register new user
   - Login with refresh token endpoint
   - Verify both tokens are received
   - Make API call with access token
   - Refresh access token using refresh token
   - Logout and verify tokens are revoked

2. **Existing User Migration**
   - Existing user logs in with old endpoint (should work)
   - Same user logs in with new refresh token endpoint
   - Verify refresh token is stored
   - Use refresh token functionality

3. **Multi-Device Scenario**
   - User logs in from device 1
   - User logs in from device 2
   - Both devices can refresh tokens independently
   - Logout all devices revokes all sessions
   - Neither device can use old tokens

### Error Path Tests
1. **Invalid Token Scenarios**
   - Try to refresh with expired refresh token
   - Try to refresh with malformed refresh token
   - Try to use blacklisted refresh token
   - Verify appropriate error messages

2. **Database Error Scenarios**
   - Database connection fails during token refresh
   - User is deleted while refresh token is valid
   - Concurrent token refresh attempts

3. **Security Attack Scenarios**
   - Attempt to use another user's refresh token
   - Attempt to modify refresh token
   - Attempt to replay old refresh requests

## Test Data Preparation
- [ ] Create test users with various roles
- [ ] Prepare valid and invalid token scenarios
- [ ] Set up test database with proper indexes
- [ ] Configure test environment variables
- [ ] Prepare load testing scenarios

## Automated Test Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for all new functions
- [ ] Integration tests for authentication flows
- [ ] End-to-end tests for complete user journeys
- [ ] Performance tests for token operations
- [ ] Security tests for attack scenarios

Remember to test incrementally as you uncomment each section of the code!
